# \# 📝 My Missing Semester Notes

# 

# This repository contains my personal notes, exercises, and resources inspired by \[\*The Missing Semester of Your CS Education\*](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).

# 

# Classes in Computer Science often dive deep into topics like operating systems, machine learning, and algorithms — but one critical skillset is rarely covered: \*\*proficiency with the tools we use every day\*\*.  

# The Missing Semester course fills that gap, and this repo is my space to document what I learn along the way.
